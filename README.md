This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/cli/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/optimizing/fonts) to automatically optimize and load [Geist](https://vercel.com/font), a new font family for Vercel.

## Features
The e-commerce app has 3 main payment methods which include Stripe, Paypal, and COD (Cash On Delivery)
You have access to the auth like you would in all e-commerces... with the ability to view products without
being logged-in and if you select a product and then log in the product you selected will be then added to your email
you can review a product.

If you run this locally or clone the repo you can then create your supper user which can have access to an admin dashboard, basically the manager controlling
Everything like COD when it was delivered and so on... 

## Deploy on Vercel

The easiest way to deploy your Next.js app is to use the [Vercel Platform](https://vercel.com/new?utm_medium=default-template&filter=next.js&utm_source=create-next-app&utm_campaign=create-next-app-readme) from the creators of Next.js.
